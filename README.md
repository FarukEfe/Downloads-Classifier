# Downloads-Classifier
 
An app that classifies your downloaded files depending on their file type. You get to choose what file types will be moved over to what directories in your computer. Once a session has started, it will be on standby in the background, checking for any downloaded files. Once it has detected a download event, it will move the file to its proper directory according to the file type.

Here's a demonstration video on how the program works:
